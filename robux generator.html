            To make this site available online for anyone, you need to host it on a web server. Here's how you can do it:

            1. **Use GitHub Pages**:
                - Create a GitHub repository and upload your HTML file.
                - Go to the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages, and select the branch where your file is located.
                - Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

            2. **Use a Free Hosting Service**:
                - Services like Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting allow you to deploy your site for free.
                - Upload your HTML file to one of these platforms following their instructions.

            3. **Use a Paid Hosting Service**:
                - Purchase a domain and hosting plan from providers like Bluehost, HostGator, or AWS.
                - Upload your files via their control panel or FTP.
